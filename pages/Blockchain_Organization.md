## Business Enterprise Blockchain

###Chain: https://chain.com/

- Cryptographer:

  At Chain, we are using blockchain technology to solve real problems at leading financial firms. To do so, we need to advance the field by designing and implementing protocols that improve on the scalability, privacy, and security of existing blockchain methodologies. We are looking for people with academic experience in cryptography to join our protocol design team and help us build cryptographically secure solutions.

  You should be interested in crafting new protocols and cryptosystems to solve interesting problems. At Chain, you will have the freedom to research and develop new cryptocurrency features with our protocol and security teams, while being backed up by a full systems engineering team.

  We like to rely on established cryptographic primitives and protocols so we can design, build and deploy complete solutions with minimal overhead and risk. We are constantly developing our threat model and try to minimize the number of assumptions that we make. We try to make our schemes easy to implement correctly, friendly to HSMs, and robust in the face of various theoretical threats, including quantum computing. While we prefer conservative cryptography, we nonetheless try to use it creatively to build innovative schemes. At the same time, we keep an eye on more cutting-edge technology (such as pairing-based cryptography) to be ready for new challenges.

  As a part of the protocol team you will be responsible for leading our efforts to design cryptographic schemes, rigorously analyze them, publish white papers and work with our academic partners to ensure that our protocols are scrutinized by a wider community of professionals before they are put into production.

  ### We are looking for:

  - - Master's or PhD in cryptography, math, computer science, or related field
    - Familiarity with elliptic curve cryptography
    - Experience designing creative cryptographic primitives or protocols
    - Experience drafting or auditing specifications and security proofs

  ### It is nice, but not a requirement, to be familiar with:

  - - Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology
    - Distributed systems
    - Smart contracts

  ### Your responsibilities will include

  - - Brainstorming new blockchain concepts with our protocol engineers
    - Designing and auditing cryptographic protocols
    - Advising our engineers on secure and practical implementation

  At Chain, we are building the next generation of database technology solutions for companies including Visa, Citi, and Nasdaq. Our stack adds a focused data model, end-to-end cryptographic integration, and cross-organization replication on top of traditional database technology. We are looking for engineers who are eager to build low-level database systems that will power the future financial services infrastructure.

  ### You will be responsible for

  - - Developing and maintaining Raft libraries
    - Horizontally scaling the storage system

Corda is a distributed ledger platform designed and built from the ground up to record, manage and synchronise agreements (legal contracts), designed for use by regulated financial institutions. It is heavily inspired by and captures the benefits of blockchain systems, without the design choices that make blockchains inappropriate for many banking scenarios. Distributed ledger technology has the potential to significantly transform the financial services industry. In the future, financial agreements will be recorded and automatically managed without error, and anybody can transact seamlessly for any purpose without friction. Markets will move towards models where parties to financial agreements record them once and collaborate to maintain accurate, shared records of those agreements. Duplications, reconciliations, failed matches and breaks will be things of the past. We aspire to define a shared ledger fabric for financial services that can be deployed within existing legal frameworks, and which relies on proven technologies. Our philosophy breaks down into three pieces : engineering for the requirements of institutions, a focus on non-functional requirements, and extensibility. If you are interested in running your own Corda MeetUp group, reach out to Chris (chris@r3.com) for more information ! We'll give you all the proper training and materials to get started.

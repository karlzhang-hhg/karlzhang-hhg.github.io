## Machine Learning definition
- Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning: Fields of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Arthur Samuel wrote the first computer programs to learn how to play checkers.
- Tom Mitchell (1998): Well-posed Learning problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E w.r.t. some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Supervised Learning
## Unsupervised Learning
## Reinforcement Learning

## Learning Theory
- 3D model building with 2D images
- Cocktail party problem
